## Separate conditionals to easily identify which fails

## Favor pull over push payments

## Order your function code: conditions, then actions, then interactions

## Be aware of the platform limits

## Write tests

## Implement fault tolerance and automatic bug bounties

## Limit the amount of funds deposited
