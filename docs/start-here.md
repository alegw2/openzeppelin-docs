*Updated Oct 6th 2017, for Truffle v3.4.11 and Solidity v0.4.15.*

This is a step-by-step guide for software developers who want to start writing
decentralized applications for the Ethereum Virtual Machine. It contains the best,
most up-to-date material on the web for reasoning about and writing secure smart contract systems.

## Smart Contract Development 101

We know you're eager to begin, but really do take some time to master the
fundamentals. Start at the [cryptocurrency basics](cryptocurrency-basics.md)
until you can comfortably answer:

- what public and private keys are
- why a blockchain needs miners
- how decentralized consensus is reached

Then move on to the quick [Ethereum basics](ethereum-basics.md)
section. After these two primers, you can get hands-on with the code and deploy
your first smart contract in under an hour.

Be sure to come back periodically to the [smart contract security reference](principles.md),
because smart contract security [is hard](https://twitter.com/lopp/status/989151422800330754).

0. [Cryptocurrency basics](cryptocurrency-basics.md) links to top resources on public key cryptography and blockchains.
1. [Ethereum basics](ethereum-basics.md) explains the Ethereum Virtual Machine, gas, transactions, and other concepts related to this blockchain.
2. [Setting up your test environment](test-environment.md) introduces `testrpc` and Truffle.
3. [Writing your first contract](first-contract.md) gets you to code, interact with, and deploy Proof Of Existence, a neat application of smart contracts.
4. [Writing a secure contract](secure-contract.md) teaches you how vulnerabilities can easily creep in your code.
5. [Using web3](using-web3.md) walks you through to interacting with Ethereum and smart contracts from a web dapp.

## Smart Contract Security Reference

At OpenZeppelin, we are committed to the growth and prosperity of the
decentralized ecosystem, and thus want every smart contract that handles real money to be
secure. If you're a new developer to the space, we ask that you read, internalize, 
and widely share this reference to raise the safety bar of the industry.

* [Principles](principles.md) introduces general, high-level mandates when developing smart contracts.
* [Code patterns](code-patterns.md) gives specific recommendations on how to structure your Solidity code.
* [System architecture](system-architecture.md) provides guidance on organizing multiple contracts that interact with each other.
* [Types of vulnerabilities](vulnerabilities.md) categorizes frequently-exploited code issues into different types.
